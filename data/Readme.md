# Landing and Mid-Range dataset


Our work have been accepted for publication in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems (https://www.springer.com/journal/10846).

The folders _landing_ and _mid_range_ contains the data used to train and evaluate our algorithms, for each considered scenario. The _mid_range_ training file was over 100MB, therefore it is split in two files:  _mid_range_train_Part1.csv_, and _mid_range_train_Part2.csv_. We also provide the files in the format used to train the MultiLayer Perceptron; i.e. substracting the current state with the target state.

The best performance was obtained with a Random Forest, achieving an accuracy of 97.7% and an average Recall of 98%. For further details, please see our work: (link to publication, when it's available).
