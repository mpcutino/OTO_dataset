Ornithpter Trajectory Optimization (OTO) Dataset:

A large  data set composed by energy-efficient trajectories obtained by running a competitive planner. To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  our  proposed  data  set is the first one with a high number of pseudo-optimal paths for ornithopter trajectory optimization. We compare the performance of three methods to compute low-cost trajectories: two classification approaches to learn maneuvers, and an alternative regression method that predicts new states. Random  Forest  obtains  the higher  performance  with  more  than  **99%**  and  **97%**  ofaccuracy  in  a  landing  and  a  mid-range  scenario,  respectively.

In this repository we provide the **data**, and the **algorithms** that we use in our proposal. If you find our resuls usefull, or you want to use them in your research, please use the following BibTeX entry:
